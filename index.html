    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets\images\Thomas.png" alt="cat pic" align "right">
            <p>I am a pet parent to 4 cats, 2 males and 2 females. We also keep bettas. My wife and I are also Aunt/Uncle to 2 dogs. We moved to Austin, TX a year and a half ago, and have loved every minute of it. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We like to hike and take the dogs to the lake. I am an avid fisherman, and like to get out as much as possible. My wife likes to take pictures and is an amature photagrapher.</p>
